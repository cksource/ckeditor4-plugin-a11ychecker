/**
 * @fileOverview This file contains a code that will be inlined to plugin.js in partucilar place when
 * building AC distro.
 *
 * The reason for such approach is that AMDClean was automatically hoisting all the AMD types to the
 * beginning of the file, and executing them. Therefore Quail would... require jQuery! No matter if
 * it's overriden by any custom plugin or not.
 *
 * So with this file Quail is simply inlined inside the plugin.js file (still I'd say that we might
 * actually load it async at runtime, it would keep the file smaller).
